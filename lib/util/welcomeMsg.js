The Chainforest discord is different from other discords you enter. The bonds we develop with others are closer, and the conversation is deeper, more thoughtful, more respectful, and more supportive than you'll find in other Discord servers. 

Many Chainforest members accelerate their learnings and their web3 entrepreneurial / professional success. 

In order to make your transition into the community as smooth as possible, we recommend the following:

1. Change your Discord Server Name to FirstName - @TwitterHandle. You can do this by clicking on your PFP after you've written a message in the server, and clicking "Edit Profile"

2. Introduce Yourself. Your application will automatically populate in the #ðŸ’¬â”‚introductions channel, but you can reply to this and share any texture you may have omitted.

3. Join a conversation and post at least 3 times upon entering Chainforest. Don't be scared by the depth or entering in the middle of a conversation. Also, don't be scared if your level of knowledge is not as high as what you're seeing in the server. A core value of Chainforest is that we're all in learning mode. We don't believe in dumb questions. 

We are so thrilled to have you and for us to grow together in this unique ecosystem. Welcome!`;
